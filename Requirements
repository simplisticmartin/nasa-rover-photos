Programming Exercise 


Use the NASA API described here to build a project that calls the Mars Rover Photos API with a given day as input, returning corresponding photo images as output.  



Bonus 1: The application should cache and serve the requested images from NASA locally, for improved efficiency when making requests for the same date 

 

Bonus 2: On application startup, read the file ‘dates.txt’. The application should fetch data for these dates on startup and seed the cache. See the bottom of this document for the contents of dates.txt 



Acceptance Criteria 



Backend: 



Node.JS: Using any web framework like Express or NestJS 
REST Api:  
Accept a date as input, return urls to all the NASA Rover images taken on that date 
NOTE: Not all dates will return images from the NASA Api 
Caching (Bonus1):  
Download, store, and host the images locally 
Hitting the API with the same input twice should only make 1 call to the Nasa API 
Seeding (Bonus2):  On startup, the backend service should use dates.txt to seed the cache with data for the dates listed 
See the paragraph below for dates.txt format 
 

Frontend: 



React, Angular, or Vuejs 
Should contain an input for selecting a date 
Selecting a date should then use the backend API to get the images 
MVP: Show clickable links to the images 
Bonus: Display the images on the page 
 

Additional Features (optional, but recommended): 



Unit Tests 
Static code analysis (linters, prettier) 
Run both apps in docker 
Use Typescript for the backend application 
 

 

When complete, please send a link to your own GitHub or Gitlab repository in an email replying to the email from which you received this exercise.  

 

Bonus 2 (Appendix):  



Below are the contents of dates.txt. Notice that a few of the dates are invalid, your application should handle that gracefully.
